This project involves comprehensive data analysis on a dataset from a fictional bike store, BikeStores. The primary goal is to understand various aspects of the data, perform data cleaning, and derive meaningful insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA). The analysis covers handling missing values, renaming columns for consistency, converting text data to a standard format, and generating statistical summaries and visualizations.
Steps Involved
1.	Libraries and Data Importing
o	Import necessary libraries such as pandas and numpy.
o	Read the dataset from a CSV file.
2.	Data Understanding
o	Display the first and last few rows of the data.
o	Get a summary of the data types and missing values.
o	Provide a statistical summary of the dataset.
3.	Data Wrangling (Cleaning & Manipulation)
o	Handle missing values by filling numerical columns with their mean and categorical columns with their mode.
o	Ensure column names are consistent and formatted correctly.
o	Convert the City column to uppercase for uniformity.
4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Calculate and print the average revenue.
o	Determine the highest and lowest revenue values.
o	Count the number of orders for the 'Road Bikes' category.
o	Display data entries with revenue greater than 10,000.
